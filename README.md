# es2015
Let's dive into the latest version of Javascript.
Each new feature has its dedicated part.

## Arrows and Lexical This
Arrows are a function shorthand using the => syntax. They are syntactically similar to the related feature in C#, Java 8 and CoffeeScript. They support both expression and statement bodies. Unlike functions, arrows share the same lexical this as their surrounding code.

See js/arrow-functions.js

## Proxies
Proxies enable creation of objects with the full range of behaviors available to host objects. Can be used for interception, object virtualization, logging/profiling, etc.

See js/proxies.js

## Promises
Promises are a library for asynchronous programming. Promises are a first class representation of a value that may be made available in the future. Promises are used in many existing JavaScript libraries.

See js/promises.js
